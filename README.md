This project is about implementing  a path finding agent traveling from
point to point in a two-dimensional grid world using some the search algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS),
depth-first search (DFS), greedy best-first search (GBFS), and A* search.

The project is implemented using python 3.10 and is made in Pycharm. Additional package installed are matplotlib and numpy.

To run this project just run the python3.10 search.py or python3.11 search.py depending on the version of python you have installed.

First you will be prompted to select the testing case you would like to use(1 or 2) .You can choose either from the one provided by the project or the second one the one I made.
After, you will be prompted to select the search algorithm number(option 1 to 4) that you would like to perform and observe the grid.
