This project is about implementing  a path finding agent traveling from
point to point in a two-dimensional grid world using some the search algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS),
depth-first search (DFS), greedy best-first search (GBFS), and A* search.

The project is implemented using python 3.10 and is made in Pycharm. Additional package installed are matplotlib and numpy.

To run this project just run the search.py file. When prompted select the search algorithm number(1 to 4) that you would like to perform and observe the grid.
